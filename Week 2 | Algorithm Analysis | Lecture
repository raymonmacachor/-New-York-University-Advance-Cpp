Runtime Analysis

        - The running time depends on the size of the input.
                
                > Parameterize running time by the size of the input.
                
        - The running time depends on the operators we use, and on the types of the data they
          are applied on.
          
                > Ignore machine-dependent constants. We count each primitive operation as 1.
                
        - The running time depends on the machine's hardware technology.
        
                > Make asymptotic analysis: look at the order or growth of T(n).

                        - We compare the number of primitive operations executed by a process, as a function
                        of its input size. 
                        
                Rule of thumb to get the order of growth:
                
                        - Drop low-order terms
                        - Ignore leading constants
